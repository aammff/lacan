    But while my complete graph allows us to situate the drive as the treasure trove of signifiers, its notation, ($<>D), maintains its structure by linking it to diachrony. The drive is what becomes of demand when the subject vanishes from it. It goes without saying that demand also disappears, except that the cut remains, for the latter remains present in what distinguishes the drive from the organic function it inhabits: namely, its grammatical artifice, so manifest in the reversals of its articulation with respect to both source and object. (Freud is a veritable wellspring on this point.)

    The very delimitation of the "erogenous zone" that the drive isolates from the function's metabolism (the act of devouring involves organs other than the mouthâ€”just ask Pavlov's dog) is the result of a cut that takes advantage of the anatomical characteristic of a margin or border: the lips, "the enclosure of the teeth," the rim of the anus, the penile groove, the vagina, and the slit formed by the eyelids, not to mention the hollow of the ear (I am avoiding going into embryological detail here). Respiratory erogeneity has been little studied, but it is obviously through spasms that it comes into play. Let us note that this characteristic of the cut is no less obviously prevalent in the object described by analytic theory: the mamilla, the feces, the phallus (as an imaginary object), and the urinary flow. (An unthinkable list, unless we add, as I do, the phoneme, the gaze, the voice . . . and the nothing.) For isn't it plain to see that the characteristic of being partial, rightly emphasized in objects, is applicable not because these objects are part of a total object, which the body is assumed to be, but because they only partially represent the function that produces them?

    (692 in Fink's translation/817 in the French)

Earlier in the paper, the cut is introduced in terms of the insistence of the unconscious signifying chain:

    Starting with Freud, the unconscious becomes a chain of signifiers that repeats and insists somewhere (on another stage or in a different scene, as he wrote), interfering in the cuts offered it by actual discourse and the cogitation it informs.

    (676/799)

A little further on, it is elaborated as constitutive of the bar between signifier and signified:

    "Lest our hunt be in vain, we analysts must bring everything back to the cut qua function in discourse, the most significant being the cut that constitutes a bar between the signifier and the signified.

    (678/801)

And lastly, we get the following elliptical comment on the function of the cut vis-a-vis the subject:

    The cut made by the signifying chain is the only cut that verifies the structure of the subject as a discontinuity in the real."

1. table of 4 partial drives
  - oral
  - anal
  - invocatory
  - scopic

2. another list of partial objects / drives by Lacan:
   - the mamilla
   - the feces
   - the phallus (as an imaginary object),
   - the urinary flow.
   
   - the phoneme,
   - the gaze,
   - the voice
   - the nothing.

3. borromean knot
 - 3D mathematical object, only in 3 dimensions it is possible to tie a knot
 - expresses NAND / NOR logic, functionally complete logical operators
 - connection between space and logic

4. hypothesis:
 - autistic shapes as representations of muscles and other body parts partial drives/objects, muscles are 3d objects
 - unless properly developed, scopic drive overrides or improperly includes other drives, resulting in incorrect self perceived body image
 - skin as a 3d object, inside, outside; layers: outer - ectoderm, middle - mesoderm, inner - endoderm
 - example incorrect matchings: 
    - color based / body secretions
    - numbers / orifices

    "According to Akhand Sutra, there are eleven holes in the male body and twelve holes in the female body. This precise and concise information may surprise many people, who are genuinely interested in the perfect adult human anatomy.

Now, let us explore, enumerate, and explain the above-mentioned number game.
The Male Body:
1. Eyes: 2.
2. Ears: 2.
3. Nostrils: 2.
4. Mouth: 1.
5. Umbilicus: 1.
6. Urethra: 1.
7. Anus: 1.
The total number: 10.
Where is the eleventh hole?
We shall discuss this question a little later.

The Female Body:
1. Eyes: 2.
2. Ears: 2.
3. Nostrils: 2.
4. Mouth: 1.
5. Umbilicus: 1.
6. Urethra: 1.
7. Anus: 1.
8. Vagina: 1.
The total number: 11.
Where is the twelfth hole?
According to Akhand Sutra, the additional hole in the human body is the anterior fontanel."

6. senses
 vision : polarized / transverse waves
 hearing : non polarized waves / longitudinal waves
